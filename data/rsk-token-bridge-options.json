    "question": "Transferred tokens from Ethereum, and after 24 hours have not received tokens on RSK",

    "answer": "RSK has a different derivation path (m/44’/137’/0’/0) from Ethereum (m/44’/60’/0’/0). Liquality respects this convention. Copy your mnemonic or private key and use Metamask and add RSK as custom network, to get the same address as ethereum."

  "eth-to-rsk-metamask-timeout": {
    "question": "Metamask threw an error",
    "answer": "This is usually a timeout as the Transaction was not mined on the time expected by Metamask. This does not mean that transaction has not been mined. Please share your Transaction Hash in the #tokenbridge channel on RSK Open slack (go to https://developers.rsk.co/slack to join)."
  },
  "patience": {
    "question": "Why does it take 24 hours? Can it be faster?",
    "answer": "This is for security measures. 24 hours is an approximation, it is not exact. We are working to reduce this time in the next version."
  },
  "address-choice": {
    "question": "Why can't I choose the address?",
    "answer": "Currently it uses the token bridge always sends tokens to the same address on the other blockchain network, and so the sender and the receiver will always have the same address. You will have the option to send to another address in the next version."
  },
  "tx-history": {
    "question": "I don't see my transaction on the Token Bridge list",
    "answer": "The list is stored in local cache, so it’s not shared across devices, and its erased if you clear your browser cookies and temporary files. You can be sure than if the transaction is mined the tokens will cross no matter what the list says. If this is not the reason why it is not there please let us know in the #tokenbridge channel on RSK Open slack (go to https://developers.rsk.co/slack to join)."
